Step 1: Choose 2 Projects

  From the list, I recommend starting with these two (combines foundational DevOps skills):
  
      Project 1: Web Server using Docker
      
      Containerize a simple web app (e.g., Node.js/Python Flask).
      
      Project 2: Implement a CI/CD Pipeline
      
      Automate testing and deployment for your Dockerized app using GitHub Actions/Jenkins.
  
  Why these?  
  They align with the "General Structure" provided in the PDF.
  Theyâ€™re beginner-friendly and widely documented.
