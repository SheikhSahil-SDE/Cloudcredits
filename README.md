Easy General Structure for a DevOps Project (Short Version)

      1. Application Setup
        o Choose a simple app (e.g., Node.js, Python Flask).
        o Host code on Git (GitHub, GitLab).

      2. Continuous Integration (CI)
        o Automate testing using CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).
        o Run test cases on code commits.

      3. Containerization
        o Create a Dockerfile to containerize the app.
        o Test locally using Docker.

      4. Continuous Deployment (CD)
        o Deploy to a cloud or server (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes).
        o Automate deployment with CI/CD pipelines.

      5. Monitoring and Logging
        o Monitor using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
        o Use logging tools like ELK Stack.

      6. Documentation
        o Document steps, tools used, and configurations. 


Example Flow:
Commit → CI Pipeline (Build/Test) → Dockerize → Deploy → Monitor.
